# 🧠 Clarity Coach — Your Jargon-Busting Writing Assistant

Clarity Coach is an upgraded version of **Jargon Detector**, designed to do more than just flag confusing terms.

It explains them — and suggests better alternatives.

## ✨ What It Does

Paste in a chunk of technical writing (e.g., from a README or doc), and Clarity Coach will:

✅ Detect jargon  
✅ Explain what it means  
✅ Suggest simpler alternatives  
✅ Offer a rewrite in plain English  

## 💡 Example

**Input:**
ually helpful — especially for new devs, cross-functional partners, and open-source users.


**Output:**
| Term | Meaning | Simpler Term | Suggested Rewrite |
|------|----------|---------------|--------------------|

| microservices | Small independent components | small services | “…built from small services” |
| orchestration | Coordinated management | coordination | “…with coordination for tracking” |
| distributed tracing | Tracking across systems | system tracking | “…and system tracking tools” |
