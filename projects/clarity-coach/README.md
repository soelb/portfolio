# üß† Clarity Coach ‚Äî Your Jargon-Busting Writing Assistant

Clarity Coach is an upgraded version of [Jargon Detector](../jargon-detector), designed to do more than just flag confusing terms.

It *explains* them. And suggests *better* alternatives.

## ‚ú® What It Does

Paste in a chunk of technical writing (e.g., from a README or doc), and Clarity Coach will:

‚úÖ Detect jargon  
‚úÖ Explain what it means  
‚úÖ Suggest simpler alternatives  
‚úÖ Offer a rewrite in plain English

### üí° Example

**Input:**

> "We use asynchronous microservices and leverage orchestration for distributed tracing."

**Output:**

|-------------------|------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| asynchronous      | Not happening at same time   | non-blocking      | "We use non-blocking services..."             |
| microservices     | Small independent components  | small services    | "...built from small services"                |
| orchestration     | Coordinated management       | coordination      | "...with coordination for tracking"           |

## üß† Why This Project?

Because communication is as important as code.

Clarity Coach helps technical teams write docs that are inclusive, clear, and actually helpful ‚Äî especially for new devs, cross-functional partners, and open-source users.

‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note

Real credentials (like API keys or OAuth secrets) should never be committed to the repository.
For development, use the included credentials_template.json file and replace its placeholder values locally.
The .gitignore file ensures that your private credentials.json stays protected and out of version control.
