# 🧠 Clarity Coach — Your Jargon-Busting Writing Assistant

Clarity Coach is an upgraded version of [Jargon Detector](../jargon-detector), designed to do more than just flag confusing terms.

It *explains* them. And suggests *better* alternatives.

## ✨ What It Does

Paste in a chunk of technical writing (e.g., from a README or doc), and Clarity Coach will:

✅ Detect jargon  
✅ Explain what it means  
✅ Suggest simpler alternatives  
✅ Offer a rewrite in plain English

---

### 💡 Example

**Input:**

> "We use asynchronous microservices and leverage orchestration for distributed tracing."

**Output:**

| Term              | Meaning                      | Simpler Term      | Suggested Rewrite                             |
|-------------------|------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| asynchronous      | Not happening at same time   | non-blocking      | "We use non-blocking services..."             |
| microservices     | Small independent components  | small services    | "...built from small services"                |
| orchestration     | Coordinated management       | coordination      | "...with coordination for tracking"           |
| distributed tracing | Tracking across systems    | system tracking   | "...and system tracking tools"                |

## 🧠 Why This Project?

Because communication is as important as code.

Clarity Coach helps technical teams write docs that are inclusive, clear, and actually helpful — especially for new devs, cross-functional partners, and open-source users.
