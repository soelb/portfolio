## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Jargon Detector Locally:

1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name/projects/jargon-detector
```
2. Set up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you don't have a requirements.txt file, you can instead install manually:
```bash
pip install spacy
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

The Jargon Detector uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify complex terms in a body of text. It relies on:

* spaCy, a Python NLP library, to tokenize and analyze the input text.

* A predefined mapping of jargon terms to plain English equivalents.

* Optionally, you can customize or expand this mapping for different domains.
