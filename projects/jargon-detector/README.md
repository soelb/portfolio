# 🧪 Jargon Detector

This tool analyzes technical writing and detects complex or buzzword-heavy jargon. It highlights terms that may be difficult to understand and suggests simpler alternatives, making your documentation clearer and more accessible — ideal for onboarding, documentation, or user education.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The Jargon Detector uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify complex terms in a body of text. It relies on:

* spaCy, a Python NLP library, to tokenize and analyze the input text.

* A predefined mapping of jargon terms to plain English equivalents.

* Optionally, you can customize or expand this mapping for different domains.
