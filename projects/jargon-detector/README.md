# 🧪 Jargon Detector

This tool analyzes technical writing and detects complex or buzzword-heavy jargon. It suggests simpler alternatives to make documentation more accessible and easier to understand.

- Scans text files for complex terms
- Recommends simpler replacements from a predefined mapping

## 🛠️ Usage

You can use the Jargon Detector in two ways:

1. **Terminal** (Advanced Users):
   - Run `detector.py` to scan a `.txt` file and highlight complex jargon.
   - Example:

     python3 detector.py
     ```

2. **Web App** (Beginner-Friendly):
   - Launch the Streamlit app:
     ```bash
