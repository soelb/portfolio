## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The Jargon Detector uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify complex terms in a body of text. It relies on:

* spaCy, a Python NLP library, to tokenize and analyze the input text.

* A predefined mapping of jargon terms to plain English equivalents.

* Optionally, you can customize or expand this mapping for different domains.
