## 🧠 About Me

- I don't define myself as a developer - I build that that matter.
- Currently building a platform for engineers, analysts, project managers & more.
- Passionate about becoming a **start-to-finish engineer** - from backend to frontend and everything in between.
- Exploring tools that connect technical silos and bring ideas to life, end-to-end.
